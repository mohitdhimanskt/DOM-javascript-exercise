Exercise 3: The logo hijack

No homepage is safe from the logo bandit! Everytime he sees a Google Logo he replaces it with a logo from HackYourfuture instead: https://www.hackyourfuture.dk/static/logo-dark.svg.

In this exercise you're expected to write a JavaScript function that can be executed in the console of the Google website.

    Find out how to select the element that contains the Google logo, and store it in a variable
    Modify the source and sourceset of the logo so that it's replaced by the HackYourFuture logo instead
