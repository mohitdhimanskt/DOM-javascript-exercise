Exercise 4: What's the time?

Why wear a watch when you can check the time, live in your webpage?

    Create a basic HTML file
    Include a script tag and link the JavaScript file
    Inside the JS file, write a function that adds the current time to the webpage. Make sure it's written in the HH:MM:SS notation (hour, minute, second). Hint: use setInterval() to make sure the time stays current
    Have the function execute when it's loading in the browser
